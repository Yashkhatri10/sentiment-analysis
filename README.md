This project is a desktop-based Sentiment Analysis system built using Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and Logistic Regression for machine learning. It allows users to input a text review and predicts whether the sentiment is Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Additional features include generating a Word Cloud from the dataset, checking the accuracy of the model, saving/loading trained models with joblib, and basic help/about sections in the GUI for user assistance. The app provides a user-friendly way to perform sentiment classification in real-time.
